This will be our first approach to a simle model of a parking lot.
We will have some basic entities and I want you to complete the ones missing.
I want you to create a new class that represents a vehicle, make it with some meaningful attributes and link it to the existing cell model.
I want you to complete the parking lot class and populate it with cell objects. The constructor of Parqueadero will receive the number of cells it has.
I want you to implement a method in Parqueadero so that we know how many empty cells we have in the parking lot.
